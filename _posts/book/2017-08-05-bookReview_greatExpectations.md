## 简介
远大前程，始于一次与逃犯的偶遇，止于那位逃犯重新被捕

而主人公在经历大起大落后，也终于放弃这种远大前程的梦想，重新开始找寻以前的美德，开始了暂新的生活

至于结局，好像主人公不小心当了一个`备胎`...

## 一些想法

此书让我想起了《红与黑》里的主角-`Jelien`，`Jelien`也是向往着远大前程的生活，可惜，他没有本书主人公`Pip`的运气，只能靠自己拼搏。而且由于做错了决定，也弄得不能善终。

而本书中的主人公则明显运气更好，在一次偶然的机会帮助了一个逃犯`Magwitch`后，他获得了他的资助，从此就有了资本去追求更高端的生活，不用为财富担心，不用苦心的提高地位，一切都是因为他的幸运。

当然，最终，主人公也算是洗尽铅华，重新过上平淡的生活了，并且相隔许久后还重新抱得美人归，比之`Jelien`的结局又不知道好了多少倍

还有一点，此书的结局也让我颇有怨念，总感觉主角被迫当了一个`备胎`，在作者的笔下，具有美好品质的`Beddy`嫁给了主角老实的姐夫`Joe Gargery`

而主角，在历经辛苦，终于成为一个成熟而又有魅力的男人后，却仍然是接受了傲慢，刻薄的`Estella`

相比好友`Herbert`与`Clara`的稳定爱情，主角实在是过于凄惨，长时间的单身待遇，仰慕女神，但是从不被女神放入眼中，更可恨的是，眼中的女神宁愿嫁给一个混球也不愿靠近主角，多让人伤心

最终，在`Estella`遭遇生活的不幸后，又想重回主角的怀抱，或许这就是外国版本的`找个老实人嫁了`吧！

PS：在当今时代，最终主角的行为确实让我想到了一句话`当然是选择原谅她`，眼前尽是`保护色`...

## Introduction

`Great Expectations`，starting from an occasional encounter with a fugitive，the end was when the fugitive was re-arrested.

After experiencing ups and downs, `Pip` finally given up the dream of the `Great Expectations`, and start to begin a new life with the old virtues.

At the end, as if `Pip` accidentally became a `backup`

## Some thoughts

This book reminds me of the 《The Red And The Black》, and the `Jelien`.

`Jelien` was also longing for the `Great Expectations`, but unfortunately, he did not has the luck like `Pip`'s.

All he can do was rely on his own hard work, and because of the wrong decision, he lose his life, became a tragedy.

Compared with `Jelien`'s life, `Pip`'s luck was obviously better.

After he helped a fugitive named `Magwitch`, he got his funding.

Since then, he start a new luxurious life, spending `Magwitch`' money.

It was all because of his good luck.

Of course, in the end, `Pip` was restarted a plain life.

But compared to the outcome of `Jelien`', `Pip`' was a thousand times better.

The outcome of this book also makes me quite resentment, because `Pip` was forced to be a `backup` of the `Estella`.

How could this be!

He should live with `Beddy`, because `Beddy` had  some good virtues, but `Beddy` was married to his honest half-brother named `Joe Gargery`.

And `Pip` was still love `Estella`, the arrogant and mean women.

`Pip`' good friends, `Herbert` and `Clara`'s love was stable, but `Pip`' love was too miserable.

Single for a long time, his Goddess married to someone else, and finally had a `forgive hat`.

Maybe for `Estella`, she was `look for good person to have married`, and finally succeed.
